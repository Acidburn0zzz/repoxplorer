refactoring:
  - Rework the project page to be more adapted to a large
    amount of projects
  - Rework the contributors page to be more adapted to a large
    amount of contributors. The original implementation was
    slow. Now the page only display a search box and uses the
    new search_authors endpoint.
features:
  - Add a welcome page where a custom HTML string can be embedded.
  - Now branches can be defined at repository level and not only at
    project-template level.
other:
  - Display the repoXplorer version in the UI.
  - Remove Dulwish dependency and only be based on Git binary
  - Far better performance when parsing and indexing Git repos
